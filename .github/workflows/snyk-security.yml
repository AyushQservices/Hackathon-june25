# Security Fixes Documentation

## 1. Secrets Found and Removed

### Hardcoded Secrets Found:
1. Azure Storage Key in `secrets.txt`:
   - Key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqLfF82==`
   - Action: Removed and should be stored in Azure Key Vault or GitHub Secrets

2. Database Credentials in `appsettings.json`:
   - Connection string with plain text password
   - Action: Should be moved to environment variables or secure configuration

3. API Key in `appsettings.json`:
   - Plain text API key: `12345-PLAIN-TEXT-API-KEY`
   - Action: Should be moved to environment variables or secure configuration

## 2. Dependency Updates

### .NET Framework Update:
- Upgraded from .NET 5.0 to .NET 7.0
- Reason: .NET 5.0 is end-of-life and has known security vulnerabilities
- Benefits: Latest security patches and features

## 3. Docker Image Improvements

### Base Image Updates:
- Upgraded from `dotnet/aspnet:5.0-alpine` to `dotnet/aspnet:7.0-alpine`
- Added non-root user for security
- Improved multi-stage build process
- Reduced attack surface by using minimal Alpine-based images

## 4. Security Tools Used

1. **Secret Scanning**:
   - Gitleaks: Integrated into GitHub Actions workflow
   - Scans both current code and git history

2. **Container Scanning**:
   - Trivy: Integrated into GitHub Actions workflow
   - Scans for OS and library vulnerabilities
   - Fails on CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues

3. **Snyk Security Platform**:
   - Snyk Code (SAST): Static Application Security Testing
   - Snyk Open Source (SCA): Software Composition Analysis
   - Snyk Container: Container vulnerability scanning
   - Results integrated with GitHub Code Scanning

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

1. **Added Security Jobs**:
   - Secret scanning with Gitleaks
   - Snyk Code (SAST) analysis
   - Snyk Open Source (SCA) monitoring
   - Container scanning with both Snyk and Trivy
   - GitHub Code Scanning integration

2. **Pipeline Structure**:
   - Security checks run before build
   - Build only proceeds if security checks pass
   - Multiple layers of security scanning
   - Results visible in GitHub Security tab

## 6. Required Secrets

1. **SNYK_TOKEN**:
   - Required for Snyk security scanning
   - Should be added to GitHub repository secrets
   - Can be obtained from Snyk dashboard

## Next Steps

1. Move all secrets to environment variables or secure configuration
2. Implement proper secret management in the application
3. Regular security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
4. Monitor for new vulnerabilities
5. Set up Snyk account and add SNYK_TOKEN to GitHub secrets
6. Review and address any findings from Snyk scans
